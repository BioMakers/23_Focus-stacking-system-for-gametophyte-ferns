I tried a few things that might plausibly have worked, but didn't.


1) Canon 2x teleconverter 

I just tried putting the Canon 2x teleconverter on between the camera body and the olympus Zuiko tube lens, and it didn't work for a couple of reason. 

Firstly the physical design of the tube lens is too narrow at the base when focussed to infinity. If I focus at 15m it fits. Once I set the focus right the lens went on but the camera body gave error messages and couldn't take any shots. 

Fortunately it was okay when I took the teleconverter off again. It might have been to do with the EOS to olympus converter which also has a chip in it to accommodate the canon electronics. 


2) Shrivelled up fern solutions - What didn't work?

- Putting wet paper towel inside the cup.
- Moving the flashes further away.
- Bouncing the flash off a reflector.
- Moving the whole setup into the garden (too much wind).
- Moving the whole setup into the greenhouse (fern still shrivelled up, but slower)
- Photographing a verbena bonariensis flower (still shrivelled up)
