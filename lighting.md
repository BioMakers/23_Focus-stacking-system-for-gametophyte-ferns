The rig can be lit with natural light if long exposures are to be used, or with flashes, for shorter exposures that will stop any movement in the rig. My lighting equipment is as follows:

Yongnuo YN-560 IV Flash Speedlite x3<br>
Yongnuo YN560-TX Trigger - Wireless flash controller<br>
14 x AA rechargeable batteries<br>
A polystyrene cup to use as a diffuser. These are hard to come by now, but can be bought from ebay in sets of 25.
