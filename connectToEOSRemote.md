## Setting the parameters for the photography

The process of setting the parameters for the photography is quite tricky. Here is what I do:

* Connect the camera to a laptop using a USB cable and the EOS Remote software
* Set up the subject and the camera in approximately the right position. 
* Set the camera on live view and adjust the subject so it is visible on the computer screen. 
* Make sure to racket the microscope block plate back as far as it will go, so that when the computer starts to step it forward there is no risk of running out of movement before the subject is completely photographed. 
* Move the camera until the subject is in focus. 
* Take a few test shots and see if the exposure is right. This is controlled from the laptop and not through the camera controls. 
* Use the microscope block focus knob to move the camera back and forth, and see how the subject is resolving on the screen. 
* Set up the lighting and take some test shots. 
* Check that the test shots are arriving in the computer. 
* Power on the Arduino or Raspberry Pi and get it ready to control the system. 
* Start the script and walk right away so that vibration does not affect the photography. 
* Check back periodically to see when the camera has moved forward enough to have photographed right through the subject. 
* Set up Helicon Focus to compile the slices into a stack, and cross fingers.
