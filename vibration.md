In macrophotography at this scale it is essential to minimise vibration. I did this by controlling the camera remotely from the laptop and setting it up so that the shutter would not move when a photograph was taken. We also put the entire assembly on a couch cushion so that if there was any vibration at all, then the entire assembly would move together, rather than the photographic subject and the camera moving independently of one another. This was suggested to me by members of the online discussion forum http://www.photomacrography.net/.

Below is a photograph of the cushioning system. The whole photographic setup is mounted on a strong piece of worktop, and the piece of worktop is sitting on top of a couch cushion on a wooden floor. 

Even with this system in place we found that just lifting or lowering a foot onto the wooden floor board was enough to cause very clear vibration, with the image going completely out of focus for a second in live view on the laptop screen. Having figured this out, we were very careful to walk very softly and slowly past the assembly while it was taking a series of shots.
