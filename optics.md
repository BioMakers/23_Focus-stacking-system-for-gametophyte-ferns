This image shows the camera setup with the Mitutoyo 10 microscope objective for 10x magnification. The objective was the major item that was bought with the money from the Biomaker grant. It has a long working distance (about 3.5cm) which is very useful for lighting and for minimising variation between the images that would make merging difficult. 

The objective is mounted on an Olympus Zuiko 200mm prime lens.
